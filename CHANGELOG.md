## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The server now attempts to re-connect to an RTK base station if the base
  station disappeared briefly for at most 30 seconds while it was being used.
  This helps to recover automatically in cases when the RTK base station was
  plugged into an unpowered USB hub and the device disappeared briefly from the
  OS due to power issues on the USB port.

- The RTK extension of the server can now be configured to send RTK corrections
  only for a subset of all supported GNSS types; for instance, one can now
  configure the extension to send corrections for GPS and GLONASS only, saving
  bandwidth in geographical areas where BeiDou is not relevant.
